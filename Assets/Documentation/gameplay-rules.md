# Mage Wars - Gameplay Rules

## Setup

Organize all cards into Decks based on the card backs:
- Mage
- Fate
- Quest
- Enchanted
- Mystic
- Arcane

Shuffle each deck and place them on the table.

## Selecting Your Mage

Each player selects a Mage Card from the Mage Deck (this can be drawn at random, or players can choose their Mage). This card specifies:
- **Health**
- **Armor**
- **Alignment** (Good/Evil/Neutral)
- **Max Pets/Plants** allowed
- **Number of Fate Cards** to draw per turn
- **Max cards** allowed in player hand
- **Win Condition** - how to win the game, which differs for each Mage type

## Health Cards

The player draws cards from the Enchanted, Mystic and Arcane Decks (as indicated on Mage Card), and places them face-down on one side of his/her Mage Card as Health Cards (function as hit points).

On their turn, a player may choose to remove one or more of his/her Health Cards and use it as if it were drawn from a deck (with reduced or no resource cost, depending on Mage Card). Of course this action uses the Mage's Health, which if reaches zero means the Mage has died (although they may attempt to Resurrect - described later).

## Turn Structure

On his/her turn, the player draws the number of Fate Cards indicated on his/her Mage Card from the Fate Deck. The Fate Cards are played immediately, and typically instruct the player to draw cards from the other decks, though there are some exceptions.

Cards drawn from the various decks go into the player's hand, and can be played that turn.

## Resources and Requirements

Any card with one or more Resource icons listed in the top right corner may be optionally used as a Resource to fulfill the Requirements of other cards. If a card is used as a Resource, its primary purpose (Spell, Challenge, etc.) is no longer usable.

Many cards have Requirements listed along the bottom that must be filled in order to activate them (craft item, cast spell, unlock level, etc.). The player may place as many of these on the table in front of him/her, and start placing cards from his/her hand with Resources (shown in the top right corner of the cards) to fill the corresponding requirements.

Only one Resource from a card can fill one Requirement, even if more than one is contained on the card. (Maybe not… maybe as many Resources present on a card apply to Requirements).

When all Requirements of a Manifestation Card have been met, the card is activated, and can be used in various ways depending on the type of card.

## Card Types

### Creature/Plant Cards

If a player's Mage Card indicates one or more Pets/Plants allowed, the player may keep the Creature as a Pet (placed next to Mage Card on table), and will get permanent bonuses as indicated on the card. If the max Pets allowed is already met, the player can choose to discard an existing pet to make room for the new one.

The other option of a Creature Card is to play it as a one-time attack/use. The effects of which are indicated on the card, after which the card is discarded.

### Item Cards

Work the same as Creature cards, but the Item must be placed in one of the Mage's Item slots, or used as a one-time use/attack and discarded.

### Magic Cards

Use as indicated on the card - typically one-time uses.

### Structure Cards

These cards have an Alignment (Good/Evil/Neutral) and/or Element and are constructed by fulfilling their Requirements. Structure Cards serve as Win Conditions for certain Mage Cards.

Structure Cards are placed in the center of the table, and their Requirements can be contributed to by any player on his/her turn. Once constructed, a Structure Card has a persistent effect for all players, and may also have a one time upon-construction or upon-destruction effect, specified on the card.

These effects are specified on the Structure Card itself, and may only affect players of certain Alignments, certain Level, Element, pet owners, etc.

### Level Cards

If the level number indicated on the Level Card is exactly one higher than Mage's current level, the player may place it on the table and start satisfying the Quest Requirements (which are more elaborate than typical Creature/Item/Spell Requirements) in order to activate the card. If the level is not exactly one higher, the player may save the card in his/her hand.

When the Level Card is activated, the collected Requirement cards are discarded, and it is placed next to the player's Mage Card on the table. The Mage is now of the indicated level, and receives the Buffs listed on the Level Card.

### Challenge Cards

The unique Conditions of a Challenge Card, specified on the card, must be met the turn that it is played. If the challenge is won, the player may apply the Reward specified on the card. Some Challenges have a Consequence to the player if the challenge is not won.

### Resource Cards

These cards are only used as Resources to fulfill the Requirements of other cards. In some cases they contain a Permanent Resource that can be activated by fulfilling Requirements of the card.

### Curse Cards

These cards are scattered through the various decks, and have various negative effects on the player that draws the card, such as lose a turn, discard # cards, lose an item, etc.

### Blessing Cards
However, there are Blessing Cards (Negate Curse and Deflect Curse) that can be drawn or crafted that either cancel the curse or allow the player to project the effects of the Curse Card onto another player.

## Combat System

### Attacking Mages

Many cards involve attacking another player's Mage Card. Attack damage is calculated as follows:

1. The number of Armor Cards in the Mage's Armor pile is subtracted from the number of Damage points indicated on the card (unless otherwise indicated by the attack card)
2. Any other defense buffs specified by the Mage's Pet cards, Potion effects, Items, etc. are subtracted from the Damage points
3. The remaining number of cards is subtracted from the Mage's Health pile

### Attacking Other Cards

For attacks on Pets, Structures, Armor, Items, or other specific cards, the Health of the defending card is indicated on the card itself.

- If an attack does less than the defending card's Health, it has no effect
- If the attack Damage is greater than or equal to the defending card's Health, it is killed/destroyed

Such attacks can only be done on completed Pets, Armor, Items, Structures. While they are in the process of being crafted, they are susceptible to other forms of meddling however.

## Charges

Some cards have a certain number of charges, or uses, such as the Bow card. Once crafted, the Resource cards used to fulfill the creation Requirements are turned face down and become Charges. Each time the card is used, one Charge card is discarded. Once the last Charge card is discarded, the main card is also discarded.

## Discarding

When a card is discarded, it is placed face-up near the deck it was drawn from. If the deck runs out, the associated discard pile is shuffled and becomes the new deck.

**Note:** There are a few cards that allow the player to draw from the discard pile if desired.

## End of Turn

When a player has finished his/her turn, the player to their left begins by drawing the number of Fate Cards indicated on their Mage Card (plus possible buffs from Level, potions, etc.).

## Winning the Game

The game is won when one player meets the Win Conditions specified on their Mage Card.

## Resurrection

When a Mage is killed, the player is not out of the game. They discard:
- All cards in their hand
- All their Mage's Item, Pet and Armor Cards (but not Level)
- Any Manifestations (spells, creatures, items) in process

Each turn they may draw 1 card from each of the Enchanted, Mystic and Arcane decks and keep or discard drawn cards up to the Max Cards specified on their Mage Card.

Once the player can fulfill all Resurrect Resources, the player may draw Health cards from the decks indicated on their Mage Card, and take a turn immediately.
